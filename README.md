# Image-Classification-Using-BoVW
# Abstract
This project aims to classify images using the Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) technique. The BoVW approach involves retrieving information, or feature descriptors, from an image and then training a classifier on histograms of these features to predict the class of a given data sample. Two different datasets were used in this study: objects dataset and flowers dataset. The object dataset was pre-divided into training and testing segments, while the flowers dataset was split into 80-20 train-test portions before proceeding with the analysis. Both support vector machine (SVM) and random forest algorithms were employed to train the classifier. The results of the study demonstrate the efficacy of the BoVW technique in classifying images, with SVM and random forest models achieving high accuracy rates on both datasets.
#Methodology

#Instructions for setting up the environment
In order to run the code, it is imperative to ensure that the relevant libraries are installed in the working environment. The libraries required for this purpose include OpenCV Python, Python, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Numpy. To install these libraries, one may run a command in the IDE with the package name appended with an exclamation mark. This will trigger the installation process via the "pip" package manager.
